### Overview

This page covers any general information for the {{page.boardname}} board.
It is currently available through [AliExpress](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DFbcrJJ).

### Features

- MCU: STM32F072RBT6
- Firmware: Klipper
- Supports 12-24V DC power supply, which makes the power supply more stable and eliminates the need for step-down modules.
- Driver working mode support: SPI, UART, STEP/DIR
- Support driver: supports external TMC5160Pro, TMC5160, TMC2209, TMC2225, TMC2226, TMC2208, TMC2130, A4988, etc.
- Expansion interface: BLTouch (Servos, Probe), UART X1, 12864 X1
- Fans: Two-wire controllable fan X2, parallel fan X2, normally open fan X2
- Temperature sensor: 2-way NTC 100K
- Supported machine structures: Cartesian, Delta, Kossel, Ultimaker, CoreXY
- The new plug-in driver can prevent the driver from being connected reversely

### Driver Jumpers

There are no jumpers to install with the 2209 drivers.  

### Driver Diag Pin

The driver diag pin is used for sensorless homing and stall detection.
To enable the diag pin, add a jumper as shown in the image below.
